### Project Overview

 Our aim in this project is to explore the movie dataset and find some movies with high ratings. Your friend has just begun with his vacations and wants you to suggest some good movies for him to watch.


### Learnings from the project

 Working and managing the python lists.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I looked into the problem statement and it was clear so I followed the instructions that were present.



### Challenges faced

 Managing the list so I had to go back and read about the list and its methods. And sometimes I got confused in interpreting the instructions. Having a clear mind is what all you need and obviously some external help from the peer learners that was a saviour.
